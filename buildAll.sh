# pico-phoenix build all script
# Builds picoPhoenix for every supported hardware configuration, in Release.
# Binaries are copied to the releases folder.
#
# RP2350 only: every config is built with -2 (the build refuses RP2040, so
# HW_CONFIG 3 and 4 are not built; 11 is deprecated). The emulated board is
# light and needs neither PSRAM nor HSTX, so both video back-ends are built:
# HSTX on 2, 5, 8, 13, 14 and 15, PicoDVI on 1, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12.
